## So what's my deal?
As you might have guessed, I'm a software developer! Believe it or not, I love to write software (Also known as banging on your keyboard until code decides to run correctly). I am a Magna Cum Laude graduate with a BS in Computer Science who has his eyes on pursuing a master's degree. Currently going through my first few years as a developer. This means I'm really excited to work on projects, growing in my ability to code, and might write some silly functions from time to time.

Now there are things that I do outside of a text editor. You will often find me playing some of them 'video games' 🎮 on steam. I am pretty big on the environment and the creatures that live in them. Currently trying to find a project that can combine both the environment and code ❤️. As an x-film major, I do find myself watching more movies than I care to express 🎥. Also I just recently found the joy of reading! Being dyslexic I am pretty late in finding out how cool books 📖 are. So if you have any suggestions, please throw them my way.

But Hey, in all seriousness I love to joke, smile, and have a light atmosphere about myself. This doesn't mean that I am unable to complete objectives or to act buttoned up during a business setting. Part of being a professional is understanding where the lines are in the business world and not to cross them. If we can land on the moon or cure polio, we can definitely have a good time during a work setting while not compromising our productivity. 

Happy Devs -> Better Code -> Better Product -> More Users -> Happy Bosses -> Everyone Gets 💰.
